A sophisticated habit and task tracking application built with Flutter and Firebase, featuring the **ONLY** app that combines binary, time, and quantity tracking in a unified system.

## 🚀 Overview

nHabit Tracker is the **ONLY** habit and task tracking app that combines **three tracking methods** in a unified system:
- **Binary Tracking** (Done/Not Done)
- **Time Tracking** (Duration)  
- **Quantity Tracking** (Numbers/Units)

Unlike competitors who force you to choose between tracking methods, nHabit Tracker lets you track everything with complete flexibility. Whether you want to track "Did you exercise?" (binary), "How long did you exercise?" (time), or "How many reps did you do?" (quantity) - or all three together - this app handles it seamlessly.

## 🏆 **TRIPLE TRACKING SYSTEM** (Market First!)

### **The ONLY App That Combines All Three Tracking Methods**

#### **🔘 Binary Tracking (Done/Not Done)**
- Simple yes/no completion tracking
- Perfect for: "Did you take your vitamins?"
- Visual checkmarks and completion status

#### **⏱️ Time Tracking (Duration)**  
- Precise duration logging with timer integration
- Perfect for: "Meditate for 20 minutes"
- Session-based time tracking with calendar visualization

#### **📊 Quantity Tracking (Numbers/Units)**
- Numerical progress with custom units
- Perfect for: "Read 30 pages" or "Do 50 push-ups"
- Flexible units (pages, reps, glasses of water, etc.)

#### **🔄 Combined Tracking (All Three Together)**
- Track the same activity with multiple methods simultaneously
- Example: "Exercise" → ✅ Done + ⏱️ 45 minutes + 📊 3 sets of 10 reps
- Complete flexibility - use any combination that fits your needs

### **Real-World Examples:**

| Activity | Binary | Time | Quantity | Your App | Competitors |
|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Reading** | ✅ Did you read? | ⏱️ How long? | 📊 How many pages? | **All Three** | Binary OR Time |
| **Exercise** | ✅ Did you work out? | ⏱️ How long? | 📊 How many reps? | **All Three** | Binary OR Time |
| **Work** | ✅ Did you work? | ⏱️ How long? | 📊 How many tasks? | **All Three** | Binary OR Time |
| **Study** | ✅ Did you study? | ⏱️ How long? | 📊 How many problems? | **All Three** | Binary OR Time |

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Other Apps**: Force you to choose between tracking methods
- **Your App**: Track everything with complete flexibility
- **Result**: More comprehensive insights and better habit formation

### **🏆 TRIPLE TRACKING SYSTEM** (Market First!)
- **Revolutionary**: The ONLY app that combines binary + time + quantity tracking
- **Complete Flexibility**: Track any activity with any combination of methods
- **Real-World Examples**: 
  - "Exercise" → ✅ Done + ⏱️ 45 minutes + 📊 3 sets of 10 reps

### Instance-Based Architecture
Unlike traditional habit trackers that show all future occurrences, nHabit Tracker uses **on-demand instance generation**:
- Shows only the earliest pending instance per activity
- Cleaner, less overwhelming user experience
- Next instance automatically created on completion
- Inspired by Microsoft To-Do's approach

### Fractional Points System
Revolutionary scoring system that enables fair comparison:
- Points calculated based on activity frequency and importance
- Example: A habit done 3x/week with weight 2 = 0.857 daily points per completion
- Enables meaningful comparison between different frequency activities

### Completion Windows
Realistic habit tracking with flexible timeframes:
- Not just "due today" but "due between X and Y"
- Reflects real-world habit completion patterns
- Visual indicators for window start/end times

### Weekly Aggregation View
Advanced progress tracking for recurring activities:
- Shows weekly targets and completion status
- Example: "Completed 4/5 times this week" for a 5x/week habit
- One-off tasks display individual completion status

### Smart Bucketing & Processing
Intelligent organization and handling:
- Automatic detection of expired habit instances
- "Needs Processing" section for items requiring attention
- Bulk processing capabilities for efficiency

### Multi-Session Time Tracking
Detailed work pattern analysis:
- Each work session tracked separately
- Calendar view shows individual sessions as blocks
- Useful for understanding work patterns and productivity
